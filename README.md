# Advanced Hierarchical Topic Labeling for Short Text
Hierarchical Topic Modeling is the probabilistic approach for discovering latent topics distributed hierarchically among the documents. The distributed topics are represented with the respective topic terms. An unambiguous conclusion from the topic term distribution is a challenge for readers. The hierarchical topic labeling eases the challenge by facilitating an individual, appropriate label for each topic at every level. In this work, we propose a BERT-embedding inspired methodology for labeling hierarchical topics in short text corpora. The short texts have gained significant popularity on multiple platforms in diverse domains. The limited information available in the short text makes it difficult to deal with. In our work, we have used three diverse short text datasets that include both structured and unstructured instances. Such diversity ensures the broad application scope of this work. Considering the relevancy factor of the labels, the proposed methodology has been compared against both automatic and human annotators. Our proposed methodology outperformed the benchmark with an average score of 0.4185, 49.50, and 49.16 for cosine similarity, exact match, and partial match, respectively.
